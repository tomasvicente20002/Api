# CSS Roulette Wheel

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pder/pen/WYrRQm](https://codepen.io/pder/pen/WYrRQm).

Building a 'semantic' roulette wheel out of pure CSS. The HTML underneath is a series of radio buttons where one is selected at random after pressing the spin button. The visual treatment uses CSS to spin the ball a number of times around the wheel before coming to rest on a number. The number is played back in the center of the wheel and the historical result data is stored underneath the wheel. To begin a game, you can click/tap the "New Game" button, or swipe the face of the wheel left or right if on mobile.
